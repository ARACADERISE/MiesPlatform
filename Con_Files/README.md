Make a .gf file of any name you desire, just remember the name of the .gf file</br>
within the .gf file, type a forward slash, "/", followed by the FOLDER NAME of which consists the file you want to use</br>
followed by another forward slash, then type the FILE NAME of which you want to use</br>

**Note, when running the application, DO NOT PRESS ENTER WHEN IT ASKS FOR THE FOLDER NAME, simply type the name of the .gf folder you made**
*The program should root into Con_Files and locate the .gf file you entered, if it doesn't then please report bugs in BUGS.yaml*

## Thanks!

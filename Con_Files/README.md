Make a .gf file of any name you desire, just remember the name of the .gf file</br>
within the .gf file, type a forward slash, "/", followed by the FOLDER NAME of which consists the file you want to use</br>
followed by another forward slash, then type the FILE NAME of which you want to use</br>

### Please take note

The .gf file can only take one directory, so if you are going to connect to a file through .gf throughout the whole of the program</br>
then make mutliple .gf files</br>

# How to get the directory
**Within the .gf file, start off with a forward slash, "/", followed by the folder name, followed by another forward slash, "/", then the file name, example: /Eject_Script/database.env</br>/Eject_Script is the folder name, /database.env is the filename**</br>

**Note, when running the application, DO NOT PRESS ENTER WHEN IT ASKS FOR THE FOLDER NAME, simply type the name of the .gf folder you made**</br>
*The program should root into Con_Files and locate the .gf file you entered, if it doesn't then please report bugs in /**BUGS/BUGS.yaml***

## Thanks!
